PWA icons (required for "Add to Home Screen")

The app manifest expects these files in this folder:
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-512x512.png

Generate them using:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/ (upload your logo/favicon)
- Or export 192x192 and 512x512 PNG from your design tool (Figma, etc.)

Until these files exist, the PWA may not be installable on some devices.
